Intent
	This task would be to create a game of blackjack that players can participate in.  There would need to be any number of tables (to infinite) and each table
	sits up to 5 players.  Each table will start with 10 decks of cards and pull from the decks for dealing cards to players at the table.  The deck is updated
	when dealing and when it reaches 100 cards the deck will reset to 5 new decks.  Players play against the dealer and each table plays all players at that table
	at one time.  IE players 1-5 play against the dealer at in unison for that deal.  Tables do not need ot be in sync with one another.  Players will need to be
	limited on how long they are allowed to pay the ante before they are removed from the table.  Each table will start the next deal after X time from the end 
	of the last deal.  If no players are present for the deal, the table is removed from the active tables. Winnings are distributed to the user's wallet.
