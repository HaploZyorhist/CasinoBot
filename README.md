This project is designed to help people learn how to work in a simulated work environment.  The goal is to ensure that all documentation procedures and task 
assignments simulate work structure similar to what would be encountered in the work place.  Anyone is welcome to come and use this to help build their own
portfolio and use as an example of working in a proper environment.  

Things that are required for work to be completed:
  - Testing must be included
  - Work must be documented on a Technical Discovery before task can be assigned
  - All technical discoveries must be submitted and approved before tasks can be created
  - Only work that is part of a task will be accepted into the project
