Definitions
	Wallet - a user's current amount of currency
	User - the discord member who initiated the command

Goals
	This task will need to create a tracking system for managing user wallet.  This will later be setup for using a database, but the system should allow intake of
	how much to adjust a user's wallet by and not allow them to go into the negative.  This value should be constant across the entire project and playing one 
	game will update the value that would be used for another game.
	
Dependencies
	All other games depend on this functionality and will call the methods for updating the users wallet for ante's and payouts
