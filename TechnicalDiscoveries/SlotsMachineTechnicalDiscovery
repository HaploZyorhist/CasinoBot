Definitions
	Wheel - A slider for the slots machine
	Slot - the spot on the wheel that displays a image or number for determining wins
	Wallet - the user's current amount of currency
	Line - what slots are used to calculate winnings (eg line 1 is center line, line 2 is top line, line 3 is bottom line, etc)

Intent
	The goal of the slots machine is to create a slot machine functionality that allows players to gamble against the randomness of slot wheels.  The slot wheels should
	be preset in what order the icons are in, they should randomly select a center spot for where the wheel lands then calculate winnings based on whether they paid to 
	play on that line.  The slots winnings are part of a pool of money that is based on how many plays have been played.  It should increase at each play and should 
	reset to a base value when someone wins the jackpot.  It also updates for winnings, never dropping below a certain value.
	
	Dependencies
		No tasks depend on this taks
		This task depends on the user currency update task
		
	Risks
		If implimented improperly the user can have improper amounts of currency paid or incorrect amount of currency won
		If implimented improperly the machine winning value may not reset 
		If implimented improperly the winning value may not increment for the user's pay in
		if implemented improperly the wheels can calculate payout in the wrong directions (ie vertical calculation of the wheel vs horizontal calculation of the
			wheel)
		If wheels are updated at a later time, the system needs to be able to have minimal changes to allow for the proper calculation of winnings and proper
			rolling to make sure that all slots are accounted for
